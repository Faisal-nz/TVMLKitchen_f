[TVML](https://developer.apple.com/library/tvos/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/ATV_Template_Guide/) is a good choice, when you prefer simplicity over dynamic UIKit implementation. TVMLKitchen helps to manage your TVML **with or without additional client-server**.  Put TVML templates in Main Bundle, then you're ready to go.

Loading a TVML view is in this short.

```
Kitchen.serve(xmlFile:"Catalog.xml")
```

Kitchen automatically looks for the xmlFile in your Main Bundle, parse it, then finally pushes it to navigationController.

# Getting Started

## Showing a Template from main bundle

1. Put your Sample.xml to your app's main bundle.

2. Prepare your Kitchen in AppDelegate's `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`.
    ```
    let cookbook = Cookbook(launchOptions: launchOptions)
    Kitchen.prepare(cookbook)
    ```

3. Launch the template from anywhere.
    ```
    Kitchen.serve(xmlFile: "Sample.xml")
    ```

## Showing a Template from client-server

<ol start="4">
<li><p>Got TVML server ? Just pass the URL String and you're good to go.</p>
    <pre><code>Kitchen.serve(urlString: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toshi0383/TVMLKitchen/master/SampleRecipe/Catalog.xml")</code></pre>

</li></ol>

## Open Other TVML from TVML

Set URL to `template` attributes of focusable element. Kitchen will send asynchronous request and present TVML. You can specify preferred `presentationType` too. Note that if `actionID` present, these attributes are ignored.

```
<lockup
    template="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toshi0383/TVMLKitchen/master/SampleRecipe/Oneup.xml"
    presentationType="Modal"
>
```

## Presentation Styles

There are currently three presentation styles that can be used when serving views: Default, Modal and Tab. The default style acts as a "Push" and will change the current view. Modal will overlay the new view atop the existing view and is commonly used for alerts. Tab is only to be used when defining the first view in a tabcontroller.

````swift
Kitchen.serve(xmlFile: "Sample.xml")
Kitchen.serve(xmlFile: "Sample.xml", type: .Default)
Kitchen.serve(xmlFile: "Sample.xml", type: .Modal)
Kitchen.serve(xmlFile: "Sample.xml", type: .Tab)
````

## Tab Controller

Should you wish to use tabs within your application you can use `KitchenTabBar`. First, create a `TabItem` struct with a title and a `handler` method. The `handler` method will be called every time the tab becomes active.

**Note:** The `PresentationType` for initial view should always be set to `.Tab`.

````swift
struct Moviestab: TabItem {

    let title = "Movies"

    func handler() {
        Kitchen.serve(xmlFile: "Sample.xml", type: .Tab)
    }

}
````

The following should then be included in your `AppDelegate` directly below the `Kitchen.prepare()` method.

````swift
KitchenTabBar.sharedBar.items = [
    MoviesTab()
]
````

## Advanced setup

- [x] Inject native code into TVML(javascript) context
- [x] Add error handlers

```
Kitchen.prepare(launchOptions, evaluateAppJavaScriptInContext:
{ appController, jsContext in
    /// set Exception handler
    /// called on JS error
    jsContext.exceptionHandler = {context, value in
        LOG(context)
        LOG(value)
        assertionFailure("You got JS error. Check your javascript code.")
    }

    /// SeeAlso: http://nshipster.com/javascriptcore/
    /// Inject native code block named 'debug'.
    let consoleLog: @convention(block) String -> Void = { message in
        print(message)
    }
    jsContext.setObject(unsafeBitCast(consoleLog, AnyObject.self),
        forKeyedSubscript: "debug")

}, onError: { error in
    let title = "Error Launching Application"
    let message = error.localizedDescription
    let alertController = UIAlertController(title: title, message: message, preferredStyle:.Alert )

    Kitchen.navigationController.presentViewController(alertController, animated: true) { }

})
```

## Handling Actions
You can set `actionID` and `playActionID` attributes in your focusable elements. (e.g. `lockup` or `button` SeeAlso: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/17704 ) Kitchen receives Select or Play events, then fires `actionIDHandler` or `playActionHandler` if exists.

```
<lockup actionID="showDescription" playActionID="playContent">
```

```
cookbook.actionIDHandler = { actionID in
    print(actionID)
}
cookbook.playActionIDHandler = {actionID in
    print(actionID)
}
```

Handlers are currently globally shared. This is just an idea, but we can pass parameters via actions like this,

```
actionID="showHogeView,12345678,hogehoge"
```

then parse it in Swift side.
```
actionID.componentsSeparatedByString(",")
```

## Customize URL Request
You can set `httpHeaders` and `responseObjectHandler` to `Cookbook` configuration object. So for example you can manage custom Cookies.

```
cookbook.httpHeaders = [
    "Cookie": "Hello;"
]

cookbook.responseObjectHandler = { response in
    /// Save cookies
    if let fields = response.allHeaderFields as? [String: String],
        let url = response.URL
    {
        let cookies = NSHTTPCookie.cookiesWithResponseHeaderFields(fields, forURL: url)
        for c in cookies {
            NSHTTPCookieStorage.sharedCookieStorageForGroupContainerIdentifier(
                "group.jp.toshi0383.tvmlkitchen.samplerecipe").setCookie(c)
        }
    }
    return true
}
```

## Kitchen Recipes
Though TVML view cannot be modified programatically after presented(or is there a way?), we can at least generate TVML dynamically by defining **Recipe**. Theme is customizable.

```
let banner = "Movie"
let thumbnailUrl = NSBundle.mainBundle().URLForResource("img",
    withExtension: "jpg")!.absoluteString
let actionID = "/title?titleId=1234"
let (width, height) = (250, 376)
let templateURL: String? = nil
let content = ("Star Wars", thumbnailUrl, actionID, templateURL, width, height)
let section1 = Section(title: "Section 1", args: (0...100).map{_ in content})
let catalog = CatalogRecipe<BlackTheme>(banner: banner, sections: (0...10).map{_ in section1})
Kitchen.serve(recipe: catalog)
```

### Default Theme
![Catalog Recipe looks like this](image/ss.png)

### Black Theme
![Catalog Recipe looks like this](image/ss-black.png)

**Note**: This feature is still in beta. APIs are subject to change.

### Available Recipes

- [x] Catalog
- [x] Catalog with select action handler

## Note
We don't support dynamic view reloading.
For now, if you need 100% dynamic behavior, go ahead and use UIKit.
