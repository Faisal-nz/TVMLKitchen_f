[TVML](https://developer.apple.com/library/tvos/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/ATV_Template_Guide/) is a good choice, when you prefer simplicity over dynamic UIKit implementation. TVMLKitchen helps to manage your TVML **with or without additional client-server**.  Put TVML templates in Main Bundle, then you're ready to go.

Loading a TVML view is in this short.

```
Kitchen.serve(xmlFile:"Catalog.xml")
```

Kitchen automatically looks for the xmlFile in your Main Bundle, parse it, then finally pushes it to navigationController.
